## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** (Semantic structure)
- **CSS3** (Grid, Flexbox, & Clamp for fluid typography)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (ES6 Modules)

## 🧠 Key Learnings & Features
- **Data-Driven UI:** Decoupled content from structure by utilizing a centralized `data.js` file to render posts dynamically across multiple pages.
- **Smart Responsive Logic:** Implemented JavaScript window-resize listeners to manage "View More/Less" functionality, ensuring mobile users see 3 posts while desktop users see 6 by default.
- **State Management:** Used boolean flags and the `.slice()` method to control the visibility of UI elements without modifying the source data.
- **Modern Layouts:** Utilized CSS Grid with `auto-fit` and `minmax` to create a truly responsive feed that requires minimal media queries.
- **Multi-Page Sync:** Managed consistent navigation and footer components across different HTML files for a cohesive user experience.
